there are feeder classes for each element which do all of the behind the scenes work. the main classes for each element just use the methods of the feeder classes in order to do all of the operations while abstracting away any unnecessary information. there is a command system that allows you to get around the program which the user operates at the end of each action. if the user does anything that isnt allowed, an error is raised which will prompt the reader to rerun the program and give a breif description of the error. I had to include 3 filler functions as the sepcifictions did not allow me to embed my functions within classes.

### -the code explained-

Calls the relevant function when a command is run.

#### -money converter-

Converts bitcoin to pounds and pounds to bitcoin using API to get the current exchange rates.

#### -funds-

The fiat bank has functions that deposit, withdraw, check balance, add interest and save balance which each do what they do by going into a csv file and changing the numbers. The blockchain and wallet both inherit from this class but save into a different csv file.

#### -money market-

This class has a welcome message with instructions and allows the user to input what they want to do, calling the relevant functions to do what the user wanted.

#### -games-

Has a function that sets the game mode and difficulty, a function that saves your rank to a csv file, a multiplier function which grants the user a prize based on his score, a set integer multiplier and the users rank. There are functions for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication which printout 10 simple sums for the user to answer depending on the difficulty level these can be up to 3 digits long.

This class has an initialisation function which initialises the list of items on sale with the price along with a graphic version of the list. There are functions to get the item name, get the price and with this info it can use csv files to store any item you buy and take away any item you sell. It also  has 4 different functions depending on whether you are buying or selling from the shop or the black market which will in turn call the relevant functions. There are 2 information functions which print the items and their prices graphically.
